# **Retail Store Management Platform**

This project is a **Retail Store Management System** built using **Python (Flask)**, with a simple and responsive web interface. The platform manages inventory, sales, and generates receipts, while providing real-time dashboards and export functionality.

## **Features**

1. **Inventory Management**
   - Add goods to the store with details such as name, type, cost price, selling price, and quantity.
   - Update inventory automatically when items are sold or restocked.
   - Display inventory in a tabular format with search and export options.

2. **Sales Handling**
   - Deduct sold goods from inventory and update records.
   - Generate detailed receipts for sales (including item name, quantity, unit price, and total cost).

3. **Dashboard**
   - View key business metrics like:
     - Total goods in stock.
     - Total sales made.
     - Total revenue generated.

4. **Export**
   - Export the current inventory to a CSV file for reporting or backup.

5. **Search Functionality**
   - Search inventory by item name or type.
